After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped. They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work.

"adidas women's retrorun shoes running, core black/cloud white/alumina, 8 uk",Perfect right outta the box,"True to size. If between I'd probably go with your lower end i.e 8-8.5 go 8. I wore these right out of the box for a little over 2 hours, most of which was walking around and they were incredibly comfortable no rubbing and I did not find any issue with the tongue being too stiff as I have seen mentioned in other reviews.",5.0,Reviewed in Canada on 20 October 2021,Adidas

"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",Comfortable and attractive,"I have hard to fit feet and often a wide fitting shoe looks too big and bulky.  These shoes were comfortable right away with no pressure points.  I use them for run around shoes, going to the store, etc.  They look casual but are more attractive than a running shoe.  They have a nice rounded toe box and go with any kind of outfit.  I am very happy with them.",5.0,Reviewed in Canada on 8 October 2018,Aravon
"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot,"I really need 11 1/2 but these shoes do not come in half sizes.  My right foot fits size 11 fine but not the same for the left foot.  The only issue is the blue insole - my feet perspire and the blue colour runs into my socks.  Also, the round laces look nice but they do not remain tied; they need a knot in the bow to maintain the tie.  They are very attractive shoes and do not look huge in size 12. Thank you.

"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",Great quality and comfort shoes,Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that weren’t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.,5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 27 August 2020,Aravon
"adidas women's retrorun shoes running, core black/cloud white/alumina, 8 uk",NO SUPPORT! NOT FOR RUNNING!,I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should.,1.0,Reviewed in the United States on 12 July 2020,Adidas
"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",Not as supportive as I had hoped for.,"These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn't want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I'm returning them.",1.0,Reviewed in the United States on 10 May 2016,Aravon
"adidas women's retrorun shoes running, core black/cloud white/alumina, 8 uk",Great pair of shoes!,"Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big.

Excellent pair of shoes.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2020,Adidas
"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",Can’t wear due to Poorly designed insoles,"I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing.",3.0,Reviewed in the United States on 6 October 2018,Aravon

"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",What I was looking for,"I have been trying to find a casual, but not too casual, shoe for work. I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesn't look like an athletic shoe. This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with ""dress"" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well.

"aravon women's betty-ar oxfords, stone, 5.5 uk",but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up ...,"I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it's not all the time, but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don't seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don't, the original inserts are pretty good",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 1 May 2017,Aravon
"adidas women's retrorun shoes running, core black/cloud white/alumina, 8 uk",Super cuter sneakers.,I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though. I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute.

They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.  When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight.

I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes. Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were $20 more. They run big. I wear a women’s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didn’t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. They’re big. I measured them against the men’s 7 I had from the store and there wasn’t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the men’s 6.5 I had from the store. I would’ve ordered a 5 if they were available. It’s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation. Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 23 November 2021,Adidas

dan post men's albuquerque black size: 9.5 x-wide,Quality design has been exchanged for quick profit. Sorry I gotta move on to a new brand.,"I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2021,Dan post
dan post men's albuquerque black size: 9.5 x-wide,Just a really comfortable Boot..,"I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought I’d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. I’ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot I’ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, that’s unheard of and if you’re a Boot Person you know what I’m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. I’m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and I’m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I can’t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didn’t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2020,Dan post
dan post men's albuquerque black size: 9.5 x-wide,super nice but heel fits weird,"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 19 September 2021,Dan post
dan post men's albuquerque black size: 9.5 x-wide,Update: Comfy if you can get them on.,I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.  Too bad.,2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2020,Dan post

From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out.

Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I've NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I'm wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a ""test walk"" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I've gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I've owned.

Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.

"vasque women's breeze lt low gtx gore-tex waterproof breathable hiking shoe, eggplant/anthracite, 5.5 uk",Great for farming. Light weight and versatile,"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, they’ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, I’ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when I’m wearing my summer weight socks, I’m not get boiling hot feet. So that’s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to “go” in my work boots.So far, they’ve been worth the investment!

I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down!

"vasque women's breeze lt low gtx gore-tex waterproof breathable hiking shoe, eggplant/anthracite, 5.5 uk",Best hiking shoe ever,"The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my foot’s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If you’re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these “too small”.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isn’t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary “feet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much I’m buying a second pair incase they’re discontinued.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2021,Vasque

"vasque women's breeze lt low gtx gore-tex waterproof breathable hiking shoe, eggplant/anthracite, 5.5 uk","Amazing, so happy","I’m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping they’d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldn’t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i don’t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know they’re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9’s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured I’d mention it. I love wearing these and didn’t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet. These boots are absolutely outstanding, so comfortable, supportive and waterproof...my only gripe is the treads are so good that it’s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards...",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 21 October 2020,Vasque

Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable.

"new balance - boys kvarnv1y shoes, 13.5w uk junior, pigment/ice blue","Terrible unadjustable, fixed laces!","These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess.

The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and that’s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great.

They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes.

merrell alverstone wp,More athletic Hiker than the Moab 2s,"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2020,Merrell

I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting.",1.0,Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2020,Merrell

I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.

The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them.

They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn't take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the ""fit"" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn't the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on. I can see my toes very easily. So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking. It looks very odd.

My toddler is a size 5, I ordered a 6, and the boot is big but the liner is tiny and very narrow. The width of the liner is seriously that of a newborn shoe. It’s that narrow and small. Her foot WILL NOT fit into it. Forget trying to put a foot with socks on it into the boot. I’m seriously debating on returning these if the liner is unusable and the boots won’t keep her feet warm without it. Without the liner it’s essentially a fancy rainboot, there is zero integrated padding/warmth into the boot.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 11 November 2018,Columbia

"new balance men's all coast 425 v1 sneaker, navy/natural indigo, 11",Sizing is way off.,The sizing of these is way off. I listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal (I wear a lot of NB shoes of this same style) and they were right I needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow. I returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also. so I guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit?

My previous vans half cabs lasted 9 months. I had heard good things about New Balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all.

reebok kids' yourflex train 10 sneaker,Been buying Reebok for the last 5 years,"I have two wild boys whom are 7 and 10.  They love gym and are always involved in at least one sport per season.  They are very hard on shoes because they live to run and jump.  We bought several pairs of the Reebok ATV after my oldest son saw the great commercial for them and decided he had to have a pair.  My boys wore the crap out of them and loved every minute of it.  Please bring those shoes back.  We have been hooked on Reebok for their comfort and durability ever since.I bought each of my boys a pair of the Yourflex Train 10s for Christmas to wear to school and for Gym class.  The different colored tread on the bottom of the shoes have begun to come undone after two days each.  It was obviously added last in the factory in order to enhance the appearance, but is a complete fail as it has lowered the functionality of the shoe tremendously.I've seen this happen with other shoe companies that attempt the same visual tactic.  In the future, I will not buy any shoe that screws around with the sole like this.  I'm disappointed Reebok.  I've grown to expect more from your company.  I will continue to buy your brand, but will pay more attention to what i'm buying.",3.0,Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2019,Reebok

ally union make force mens womens walking shoes lightweight mesh slip-on running sneakers gray size: 8 women/7 men,An honest review from a Shoe Addict.,"The sizing chart is wierd because it's Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9""x3"" and according to the listing's size chart, I should order a Men's 5/Woman's 6. However, I'm a US Woman's Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men's 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men's) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman's) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl's (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it's a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won't make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I'd recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead). That being said, I recommend these Sneakers as a low-cost option for travel because they are light weight, great for casual walking, easy to pack, and perfect for security check points.NOTE: I was NOT compensated in any way for my review. I paid full price for the pair I'm wearing in the photo. I think some of the other reviews may be fake so I wanted to add a comprehensive and honest review.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 23 May 2020,Ally union

adidas women's pureboost go white size: 4.5 uk,A great running shoe!,"I had a new pair of these and my college D1 athlete came home due to the quarantine - she’s a swimmer - suddenly turned runner, she swiped my shoes.  Took me a while to find the exact shoe but I did and now I have my running shoes back.  Very hard to purchase shoes when you can’t try them on.  These shoes have a soft upper that does not rub or irritate and they have a soft wide heel for the trail running I like.  They are a bit heavy but that is because the heel is solid.  The laces are a bit odd for a runner but once adjusted the upper combined with the shock absorption of the soul of the shoe makes it worth the time.  I have a narrow heel and it slips if not tied properly.  I am a size 10 and I have enough room in the toe for long runs.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2020,Adidas

I assumed they would be similar but they are not at all. I wore them out for a 5 mile walk and they destroyed the back of my heel. The shoes are not comfortable.

"clarks - womens wave2.0 step. shoes, 4.5 uk wide, stone combi",Not friendly to custom orthotics,"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.TL;DR -- don't buy if you wear custom orthotics, don't buy if you pronate, don't believe they will stretch when you try them on.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 16 March 2021,Clarks

"lifestride women's neon loafer, blush, 4 uk",Nothing fancy but they're Comfortable as all get out!!!,"Written this before but it always bears repeating: I. HATE. These kinds of reviews.They're loafer style sneakers. They're black loafer style sneakers. They're a nothing fancy wardrobe mainstay that you really don't think about much. They wear out and you get new ones so, what in the heck can you say other than that? Lol.Design-wise, they were smart and put in a scant little inch in the heel. An inch isn't noticeable in the slightest- you don't even conciously feel it but, when you have a tendon problem in your foot or heel... OMFG does that little inch make all the difference!!!The designer was also thoughtful enough to make the interior sole ever so slightly fuzzy. Anyone who has *ever* gone without socks in warm weather (pretty common to do in this style of shoe) know why that's a nice detail that is sadly lacking in a surprising number of shoes.I know that doesn't bother a lot of women because they have forced themselves to get used to it but those hard interiors that make the inside all icky gross the *instant* your body even *thinks* about sweating drive me bonkers. Lol.Maybe it's the 110F summers where I live but whatever the reason, I am always grateful for an all cloth interior for an enclosed shoe. Lol.Anyway, there wasn't any breaking in for me on these. Another nice touch. I was able to wear them straight out of the box as if I had them for years.On the other side of things, they also seem to be wearing quite well.So, yeah, they don't look like anything special and, I guess in a way, they're kind of not but, they're nicely put together enough that you *don't* really think about them. Well, at least, you don't unless you're sitting in front of a blank Amazon Review screen which, for me at least, proves that they're actually a nice product that probably won't get nearly the reviews that they probably should. ;)",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 17 May 2020,Lifestride
"lifestride women's neon loafer, blush, 4 uk",Fix your sizing.,"Everyone is being nice and saying ""These run small, haha!"" but I just ordered a size 8 and it doesn't even fit my sister who usually wears a 6. Same story with the other pair of shoes I bought from this brand. This isn't just running small, this is inaccurate sizing. Shoes aren't like clothes, I know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary. But in every other store on the planet earth I wear a size 8 (US). This is just inexcusable honestly.

"lifestride women's neon loafer, blush, 4 uk",Very pleased,"Lifestride shoes caught my eye on sale in a physical shoe store but selection was very limited so I hoped to find them similarly priced online. My usual size (9.5) felt a rather snug, not necessarily uncomfortable short term but I could not guess we'll enough what it would cause during longer wear. They seem to advertise having some kind of special arch support.. I'm not blown away by that, having said that I don't feel my feet fatigue either soo.. I guess thats working?On here I chose to go to a size 10 ""narrow"" just in case 9.5 really was too snug. I'm happy I did. The nose seems a little long but is just perfect while walking around. I have weirdly narrow long feet that also tend to get ugly gaps with low cut shoes. I still have some gaping but it isn't triggering me as much as it normally would. The shoe cups and forms nicely around my feet (no slipping off my heel yay!) and the leather is very soft.

And still the fit is interesting. It is good that they have free return option with amazon prime, cause it is not so easy to find your fit. I am returning them and dont think I will order another size, cause they dont feel right for Zumba (slippery, no ankle support). But they might be good for other dancing lessons, like ballet for non-profs. If your foot is narrow, not high arch I would even recommend going from 7 to 6, cause in time they have a tendency to strech.

linodes (tent leather upper jazz shoe slip-on for women and men's dance shoes brown size: 7 women/6.5 men,Looks can be deceiving....,"The shoe looks like it is three times too small....until you put it on and realize that it stretches at the arch area to allow you to have a hell under your heel and a pad under the ball of your foot.  Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1"" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.  Happy dancing!!",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 28 May 2019,Linodes
linodes (tent leather upper jazz shoe slip-on for women and men's dance shoes brown size: 7 women/6.5 men,Too big,"The shoes seem fine, but going by sizing guide they are too large.  Especially considering you need to have them start out fitting very tight because they will stretch.  I don't know any dancers who like their shoes to fit loose & sloppy.  You want them to fit like a second skin to your feet.  While your toes need to be able to spread, you don't want your  feet sliding or slipping inside of the shoe.Will need to return and order a smaller size.  I ordered 7 1/2 and I wear a size 8 to 8 1/2 size street shoe, but it is hard to compare that to dance shoes.  Dance shoes need to fit different than street shoes.

In my case I ordered a size up, and they were still too small.  They also have a very narrow toebox, which affects the fit as well. The insole is definitely squishy, however there is next to zero arch support. This of course can be good for some people, as can the narrow toebox ( these would be great for one of my daughters, however they are not available in her size).  They do seem to be constructed well, and feel sturdy, although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks, but I have to return these so I won't be able to find out for sure about that.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 15 June 2015,Reebok

But I could tell when I first put them on that they were a little tight right up against my big toe. The first day was the worst one. They were already feeling tight but I jumped down to the ground from a platform to run to the car and as soon as I landed, my big toenails (and yes, they were cut) hit the toe of the shoe and I could feel that little bit of pain for the rest of the day.  It's day three and I can tell they've stretched a little bit, but next time I'll try an 8 to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, they are extremely comfortable.  They're very soft and very light--I hate wearing heavy, clunky shoes.  They're the perfect shape, also.  Not too small and thin like a simple pair of old school Keds, but not too bulky that you feel like they'd only work with jeans or athletic wear.

So I got out my favorite blue suede 1100s for comparison (see pictures).1. The contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the 1100s2.and upon closer inspection, the insoles were also quite different.You can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede 1100s come with a more expensive removable insole.

This could just be a one-off, or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than I imagined. Maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic NB product?In any event, I highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer. Call ahead and ask if they have the 1100s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying. That's how I ended up with the blue ones.

BOA is using string instead of wire which it normally does and you’re not able to get a proper tight fit. Second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it. One of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the BOA strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness, which lends to a loose fit.  Folks who love and use BOA on their shoes will understand. Last major issue which is the shoe doesn’t have enough arch support, atleast IMHO.

"ariat - mens circuit competitor western western shoes, 10 m uk, limousin black",Check The Material For Defects,"These are nice looking and feel solid, however, my right boot came with a 1"" long defect on the right side near the toe stitching that appears to have had an attempt to be ""fixed."" I'll be returning these unfortunately.**UPDATE 12/02/2018**  After some thinking and looking around for other black boots, I decided to give this pair another shot.  After all, I liked their look and design, and figured I should give them another try.  My new pair came basically free of any defects to the leather.  However, the white stitching around the toe area wasn't quite as clean and neatly done as I would expect from Ariat.  I know these are only $150, but still, this kind of issue should be easily preventable.  Other than that, these boots are very comfortable, and took very little time to break-in.  Maybe a couple of days.  And to get around the slippery leather sole, I took them to a Cobbler who applied a thin rubber layer over the leather sole.  It was a great fix that I had not previously heard of!  I hate leather soles.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 14 November 2018,Ariat

lethato men’s modern classic calfskin leather chukka boots red size: 14,Dressy Silhouette but a Sole for Business,I was a little cautious at first. $99 for calfskin leather uppers. Made in Italy so I decided to order a pair. I’m glad I did. Very comfortable with generous arch support. The sole is a proprietary dainite-like sole. The famous rubber studs. It was very grippy and it seems hard wearing which I like.  Now for the leather. It’s not a smooth leather. At first glance I thought it was a waxy suede or a rough out leather. It has a matte like finish. I do like it. It pairs very well with a suit or casual wear. Don’t wear any white socks. There’s some dye issues with the first few wears.,5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2018,Lethato
lethato men’s modern classic calfskin leather chukka boots red size: 14,"Tight, odd colour but good leather",The shoe is of good leather and strong. However the colouring of the shoe is not smart.

Also, we now have about 5 pairs of the same size shoes for our 17 month old daughter. They all seem to be pretty close aside from these. They are a little big. The issue with is, for the most part they are meant to be worn without socks. The shoes being to big, and being worn without socks will cause the lacing system/tongue to bunch up and hurt.

I told her she could also wear them as a slip on and step on the neoprene backing but she complained that it felt uncomfortable under her foot.

Like most beginners he started throwing in heavy lugged running shoes and had a difficult time turning his hips. His PR’s have gone up since buying the shoes because he can simply transfer power more effectively. So if you have a beginning thrower these ASICS will boost their throws and confidence.

adidas kids&#39; lite racer reborn,Adidas Customer Service is Terrible,"My son loved the shoes, they were comfortable and fit well. The shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them. I contacted Amazon right away and they instructed me to contact Adidas for a refund/exchange. I submitted my request to Adidas on July 11 as requested by Adidas customer service. When I didn't hear anything after a few weeks I emailed them again. Several emails sent asking about an update went ignored. I had to use the chat feature on the Adidas website to get an answer. I was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on August 26. I followed up with customer service again and I was told I would receive an email update after 5 business days (the time it takes to inspect the item) and then the gift card would be issued within 7 business days. This still has yet to happen. When I contacted customer service again, they now changed their story and said that because I didn't purchase the shoes directly from Adidas I would not receive my gift card until 20 business days after the shoes were received. I am now being told that I won't receive my gift card until September 23, which is 2 1/2 months AFTER I submitted all of the required information to Adidas to start this process.

"skechers women's go step lite-innovate sneaker, black/white, 5.5 wide",like wearing socks with a sole,"love that Skechers offer so many stylish sneakers and shoes in wide width.  these are so comfortable, like wearing ankle socks with a sole.  the toe box is super roomy, and I think it would be roomy even in regular/medium width.  the fabric of the shoe allows for even more toe movement, good for me because I don't like constricting footwear.  for knockabout, running-errands footwear, you won't find anything much more comfortable than this, hence the 5-star rating.  for serious walking or standing, though, these will be lacking in arch support.  and I'd make sure to stay on flat, even terrain because the fabric doesn't provide much structure.

chaco men&#39;s z1 classic athletic sandal,Excellent Sandal,"I have used Teva's since the 90's, but when my last pair died I decided to get something that looked a bit less ""dad sandal"" despite now being a father.  I'd heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I'm normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I've noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren't using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It's also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn't work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I'm happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.  If I were in the US, I'd happily pay the amounts being asked.",4.0,Reviewed in Canada on 4 September 2020,Chaco

"ecco women's biom life low-top sneakers, (white/white 50874), 7 uk",Great lightweight slip-on,"I purchased this pair because I wanted another sneaker from Ecco, but I wanted something that was a slip-on with a less traditional style than the lace-up sneaker of which I have 5 pair from Ecco in various colors, and this fit the bill.  As with all Eccos, I can fit my custom orthotic inside with ease and somehow it does not compromise the fit of the shoe whatsoever (I wear a half orthotic which only supports the heel and arch of my foot and does not go to the toe).  The arch support without the orthotic is fair on its own and the bottom is more flexible than the other Ecco sneakers that I have, but I expected that with the style of this shoe and was what I wanted.  The sole of this shoe is not rigid so if you need that this will not provide that for you.  It is an extremely light shoe and breathable which is perfect for the warmer months.  Lately these are the pair that I grab the most and get a lot of compliments on them. They’re different than the average sneaker. They are sleeker and extremely comfortable and work with a lot of outfits, obviously more casual looks but I did wear them with skorts and cute top on vacation recently and they were perfect.  Also, great at airports when you need to slip your shoes off when going through security and super comfortable when you’re just sitting in your seat for hours on the plane ride, and really light to pack.

"timberland 6-inch leather and fabric field boot (toddler/little kid/big kid),black nubuck,1.5 m us little kid",Good Boots but not as durable as I hoped,"I am a very short 19 year old who works a construction type job - I'm on my feet all day, lifting things like concrete, shingles, and lumber. I bought these boots because tennis shoes were leaving my feet too vulnerable.I was pleased with the boots for the most part. They provided protection and kept sawdust, gravel, and concrete out. The treads had better grip than tennis shoes, so I slipped less. I wore them all winter, where I had to go out in the cold several times a day, and these kept my feet decently warm. Wouldn't recommend them as winter boots, though. They aren't water proof, so if I was in the snow for too long, my feet got wet. Still better protection from the elements than tennis shoes.I'm a little disappointed with the durability, though. It was only about 4 months until I started getting holes in the leather near the sole. I continued to wear them for another 4 months. They're not completely unwearable, but there are several holes in both boots. I only got to wear them for 8 months before having to replace them - for almost $70, I was hoping for more.

I'm so disgusted that THESE BOOTS R SO FAKE! It's TOTALLY obvious to the naked eye, u just can't tell from their pic. Real Timbs r much heavier, have 4 rows of stitching (instead of 2, nice try) & r of better quality (leather/suede/nubuck) & also weatherproof. I'm not sure what fabric these r made of but it's cheap and the ones I received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because I ordered 3 pair from 3 different groups: toddler, little kids & big kids. Maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i could've been fooled but then again they're so cheaply made I strongly doubt it! I foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just 2-3 wears; I just thought maybe that individual pair was defective. I should've known better since Ive ALWAYS paid way more for ALL of my other Timbs. I just saw the price & thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since Timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year. I spent slightly less than $160 on 3 pair of these so I initially saved about $80-$100 total but what's the point when I'm gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart?! I'm disappointed because I anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived. If u have never owned Timberland boots before then I suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel & see what type of boot U should b receiving when ordering online. If u have Timbs then it won't take u but a second to spot these knockoffs. I received the 3 pair that I purchased for my loved ones today and 3 pair r going rite back TODAY!!!!!!!

"new balance women's vongo v4 fresh foam running shoe, light aluminum/lime glo/glacier, 3 uk",Love these with a passion,"I'm an advanced runner, former collegiate track/cross country runner, averaging between 50-60 miles/week, and race 5k up to ultramarathons. I say this just to try to enforce that I like to think I know my running shoes. And I know this review is just my opinion, and that there is a perfect running shoe out there for everyone - this might not be yours, but holy cow, they are mine! I've been wearing Brooks Ghost and Launch for years, then started wearing Hoka Cliftons for long runs and recovery runs when I'm doing more ultra-focused training. I tend to find a shoe that works, then wear it religiously until they change it so much that I need to try something new, or if I get injured and that shoe feels like it has bad juju (slightly superstitious). I was overdue for new shoes, and went to buy the Cliftons but something prompted me to do some research and open my horizons. So I started looking around and came across the New Balance Vongo. I've been wearing neutral shoes for years, so was really hesitant to buy a stability shoe, but read that these are kind of on the neutral-end of stability, if there's such a thing.Anyway, with the <$100 price, I gave it a go because why not. It's now been about 2 months that I've been wearing them for just about every single run, and oh my gosh, I feel like I've hit the mother load. I recently ordered a second pair to have on standby for when my current pair is worn down, and am tempted to stock up on like 100 more pairs just so I know I'll have them for the rest of my life. The sock/knit liner is snug and keeps my foot in place, so I have no rubbing or hot spots. They are SO comfortable, they're like an extension of my foot. The foam is responsive and light so they work just as well for tempo's or interval workouts as they do for long runs. The grip is great and I actually prefer using these for trail runs over my specialty Salomon trail shoes. The only downside of these shoes (literally the ONLY downside) is that rocks seem to get stuck in the tread more often than any of my other running shoes.TLDR: These shoes rock.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2020,New balance

My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ).

That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see.

"new balance women's fresh foam altoh v1 running shoe, grey/blue, 7",I Love These Shoes!!!,"Bought these for running and had them for two weeks, before buying another pair just for work.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have had in quite a while.  I have flat feet and suffer from plantar faciisitis; I have a really hard time finding shoes that are soft enough to run in, as well as, stand in for 12+ hrs.  These shoes are great and the cushions and treads seems to be lasting very well.  For the running shoes, I have reached about 250 miles and my tread pattern matches my other shoes at this point. So I'm sure I will easily be able to get 400 miles out of them before needing a replacement pair.  For the work pair, I stand for 12+ hrs, and by the end of my shift I surprisingly have no pain anywhere in my feet or ankles.  It is incredible because usually I buy shoes and by the end of the I am in excruciating pain because of my plantar faciisitis.

Great toe protection for river walking...sometimes you gotta pull that kayak...and very attractive to boot. Super comfy and fits like a dream. I was concerned that the closed toe might be too tight for my usual size 5 in Chaco open sandals so I sized up to a 6 but that was too big. Returned that and ordered the 5...perfect fit and plenty of room for my arthritic toes and bunions in the roomy toe box. Highly recommended for flat feet, high arches and foot problems like Plantar fasciitis. BTW, for anyone annoyed by the long straps which are a classic Chaco feature enabling custom fit, the long end is easy to tuck between the elastic and the fabric at the back heel with no heel rubbing.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2021,Chaco

adidas terrex cc boat shoes mens,Functional and stylish!,"I debated these shoes and read so many reviews before I spent the money on them. I was planning a trip to Niagara Falls and knew I’d be getting wet and didn’t want to walk around with wet shoes all day. After reading so many mixed reviews — one bad, then good, then bad, etc — I have to say I can’t believe someone would write a bad review of these shoes. I’m not saying they’re perfect but you can’t beat these shoes for the money.Pros:They dry out quickly, they’re vented and they drain water, they’re stylish and they’re comfortable. I walked around NY all day in these and they were great. Are they as comfortable as my other running shoes? No but that’s not why I bought them. I bought them so they’d dry out quickly and they did. Everyone else’s shoes were still wet the next day. Mine were dry in a few hours and I didn’t put them in the sun  or anything like that. Just took them off when we got back to our room. They offered great traction while walking the wooden steps of Niagara Falls as I got drenched!Cons:They’re wide up front in the toe box which I LOVE because I have issues w my right foot and need extra room up front and these were perfect. Also, I didn’t tie these shoes once after initially tying them. They were plenty comfy right out of the box. However I read reviews of people saying they were slipping off their feet?! Did they not tie them?! Not saying someone else’s experience isn’t valid but I’m confused how this would happen. I can’t imagine tying these, let alone tying them tightly, and having them slip off your feet.And sure they’re not as comfortable as a more cushioned running shoe but these are WAY comfy for being vented water shoes. And you can always buy a cushioned sole to make them comfier.I’ve only had them for a few days but they were great for my trip and the traction was great on and off the walking tours we did. I like them so much they’re now an everyday shoe for me. We will see how they hold up in the long run but so far I’m very pleased with this purchase.

There is a bit of stretch to the sneaker so the half size down didn't hinder me, though I would still say they're true to size and I will probably end up wearing these sneakers out a bit faster for buying smaller. If you're able, I'd recommend buying your regular foot size still.That said, I absolutely adore these. So cute!

Of course, in the beginning, as with all shoes, you must ""break"" them in.  The more you wear them, the more the comfort increases.

He wrote back later that same day and told me that he was unable to intercept the order.When the shoes arrived, my wife loved the look and the feel.  The fit was just a bit roomy for her narrow foot but the shoes were very comfortable to wear.  She is keeping them.  Maybe the Propet denim sneakers run a half-size small.

harley-davidson men's bill steel toe harness boot,Quality boots!,"Of the choices on fit, I had to choose ""Somewhat Small""...HOWEVER; if you do not have a tall foot (high in-step or 'club' foot), these boots fit perfectly. I wear size 9 1/2 boots...and these ARE 9 1/2 boots. My issue is the clearance at the top of my feet---pretty tight and taking a while to break in; so just be aware of that if you have a tall foot. That is my own problem. If I had a chance to try them on before buying, I MAY have gone a half a size up if it meant the top of the boot was more comfortable, but it's too hard to tell without physically comparing the two sizes.These boots get 5 stars, because (aside from my tight at the top issue) everything about the boots screams quality. First of all; I've always been a fan of Wolverine's, and that's who makes them (their web address is stamped on the bottom of the boot). Secondly, the materials, stitching, build, weight, and looks are all flawless on the pair I received. And last, but not least, these boots (for me any way), are so cool they give you a 'cool confidence' when you put them on...kept clean, they can be worn for any occasion from weddings & funerals, to Rock concerts and Rodeos.By the way; leather is not water proof (never has been, never will be)...best thing to do to make them as water ""resistant"" as possible, is to get some Mink Oil or any other leather treatment product, and treat them. They will repel water better, and last longer.I DO ride a motorcycle...but I don't think you have to be a motorcycle rider to own these boots. If you like good quality boots, buy a pair.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 14 July 2018,Harley-davidson

I had to start a return, which by the way took almost 4 weeks to get my money back, then buy ANOTHER pair of boots in a different size. These fit better, but are still a bit too loose, but honestly i cant any longer because i meed saftey boots for work.

harley-davidson men's bill steel toe harness boot,Awesome safety and riding boots!,"Only had for one day so far, but have had them on for 10 hours  and my feet feel great. Fit fine right out of the box. Put some mink oil on last night for water proofing and with the steel toe my company covers part of the cost as I can wear them for safety boots as well as riding boots. I don't believe I will be invoking the 30 day comfort guarantee. Real nice boots for any price, but this is a great price. **** Less than 2 months and the leather is like ""peeling"". They have never been scuffed but there's like a thin shin peeling on the toe of both boots. I tried polishing to seal them better and the slightest buffing caused the top layer of the leather to wrinkle and tear. Just the thinnest layer. Still the most comfortable boots I've ever worn!

Dragging feet can happen with us all and that must be something to watch for with these shoes.

"bloch girls super jazz shoe, tan, 12 little kid",Very nice.,"Update:  Yikes!!!  I ordered two pair of Bloch jazz shoes from the warehouse.  Two different sizes.  They looked the same to me upon arrival.  My granddaughter refused to wear the first pair she tried on yesterday evening.  That review is below.  Today she wanted to try the other pair.  They fit and she likes them.  Then she proceeded to show me how the two pairs are different.  The pair she likes have the Bloch logo inside the shoe.  The first pair she tried on did not have the Bloch logo.  The color was not quite identical and the seam lines are  not the same.  The toe on the unbranded shoes is gathered, not smoothly wrapped under the toe.  I would include pictures if that option was still available.  We received one pair that is NOT a Bloch jazz shoe.  In fact, it does not have any brand name on it anywhere.  The size is stamped where the logo should go inside the shoe.  I have updated my review to five stars.  The Blotch shoes are very nice.Original review:  My granddaughter has always loved her jazz shoes.  It was time to go bigger.  These are a different brand than I have purchased in the past.  I purchased these from the warehouse.  They fit.  BUT, the seam that goes around the arch and under her foot, was uncomfortable and she couldn't get them off fast enough.  She informed me they are uncomfortable and she will not wear them.  Perhaps they were returned to the warehouse because of a defect on the seam?  Or perhaps the seam placement makes this style less comfortable. They look fine to me and seem to be the correct size.  [These turned out to be another brand, not Bloch.]I have reordered jazz shoes in a different style for her to try.  Unfortunately, these will be returned.  The warehouse price was great.  I really wanted these to work.  Oh well.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 11 April 2020,Bloch

They’re not the easiest to get on and I’m worried if we size down much she’ll just outgrow them quickly, and she doesn’t seem to mind the extra toe space, so we’re making these work.

You kind of have to expect to get what you pay for.  Unlike other reviewers, mine did not have a smell out of the package so that was a plus!  You can however tell they are SUPER cheaply made.  The mesh fabric on the back of one of my shoes is kind of sewn/stuck together funny and it creates a crease in the back of the shoe.  There is no tongue so when you pull she shoe strings, it creates a bubble on the front of the shoe.  I normally wear a 9.5 so that's what I bought and it does feel slightly large.  They are not the ""cutest"" sneakers.  The sole is a little bulkier than what I typically go for, but if you are wearing pants, it kind of covers the bulk.

So stiff it can be felt across top of foot when bending foot to step.  These are super cute though, so I'm keeping them to try to break them in...though I'm pretty doubtful that the bend is going to get any more flexible. I don't know if a shoe stretcher would help - I don't have one.  I like them enough to not return and give them a try, but if I'd have tried them on in a store, I wouldn't have purchased them.

"clarks men's forge vibe oxford, tan leather, 10.5 uk","They're Big, but Quality...","SIZINGFirst off, they're huge! I'm a 9.5/10 reliably. I got these in a 9, having read the many people who mistakenly bought their size only to discover these shoes are way way way oversized. Even at a 9, I was surprised at their footprint (no pun meant).When I sit them beside any other 9.5 footwear I own, these Clarks clearly tower past them. So look folks, buy 'em a half size down from what you normally wear.COMFORTStiff at first, but then, duh right? These are well-made shoes, so naturally they'll need time to open up and accommodate the nuanced geometry of your adorable feet. I've worn them now for about five hours at the office and they've already gone from, let's say, a 8 in stiffness to a 4. So, given a bit more time, they'll wear-in nicely. At first they also did made an audible ""pop"" sound, when folding at the toes as I open my stride. But again, when I say ""audible,"" I mean vaguely audible. I believe it's again related to their off-the-shelf rigidity. Once we beat on them a bit more, they'll surely become more malleable. Insole is soft and forgiving, without calling attention to itself as some kind of atom-splitting technology. I feel literally nothing invasive about these shoes. There is no ergonomics in design, for instance, that are stabbing my Achilles, or rubbing painfully against my well-moisturized, Irish-alabaster skin.APPEARANCELovely, unassuming, practical, wearable. Durable, well-built shoes, with rather understated style appointments. The stitching, for instance, around the sole is a nice rustic touch that appears durably manufactured. the bright(er) laces is a cool touch too, as it adds a nice contracting feature to their look. And the bone-colored sole is again a unsophisticated, but just declarative enough a treatment to call modest attention to them.FINAL VERDICTThey're Clarks, so there's that.  As Clarks go, these are a deal! Get 'em, gift 'em, wear 'em, paint the town in 'em (or the office)!",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 11 November 2021,Clarks

Kept the sand out during the 2.5 mile walk along the beach. But the second day (similar to what James H. said), the seam in the inside middle of the right heel started to rub against my heel. By the third day, same thing on the left heel. There are seams on the inside heel. If they could be made without the seam in the middle of the heel, these would be great. When you are walking on sand, even compact sand closer to the water, the shoe will slip and then any seam will cause injury to the heel.

reebok men's sublite cushion tactical rb8805 military & tactical boot black size: 11.5 wide,"Zero arch support, not a work boot.","At first, I put these on at home and stood up on the carpet in them. Ahhh... soft, memory foam. Light weight. Flexible. The side zipper is tight. The laces are thick. The leather feels like quality. Should be good right? Not so much. I'm 14 days in and I'm writing this with sore feet. Instead of writing you a story, I'm just going to list the problems with these boots...1) Memory foam is too thin, results in zero cushioning on hard surface while making your feet sweat profusely.2) No arch support. The inside is flatter than dollar store dress shoes.3) No side to side support. This means your heel will move, and since they are light and flexible, you'll likely roll your ankle.-All this can be solved with buying a nice insert from Sof Sol, like I did... except there is still one more COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE problem.4) Small cracks in the sole. Yes, water can leak up through the bottom of this boot between the tread resulting in wet feet (I hope that was water...) At least I didn't slip in it.There is one really big positive these though... The top of the boot, where it meets your shin and calf is really nice. There is nothing sharp or rough edged to make that uncomfortable in the slightest. I've tried a lot of boots over my years of military, contractor, and corrections... and the top half of these boots are best in the business.

"merrell kid's trail quest hiking sneaker, navy/grey, 5 big kid w","Lighter, more mesh/breathable, hopefully still just as durable.","In general, I haven't found any affordable toddler shoes w better traction than the Merrells on Amazon. My toddler had the M-Trail Chaser Jr.  which he wore whenever we went on dirt/pebble trails (vs. his Nike sneakers ). However, they are heavier than these and I think less breathable because there's less mesh. (See side to side photo. This shoe model is in the foreground. M-Trail Chaser is in back of it). That being said, I think those may be more durable over time and more water resistant as these have more mesh which may tear more easily and let more water in, but we shall see. I also think these are slightly wider and easier to step into than the M-Trail Chasers.They claim these are machine washable which is nice though I would probably just spray them down w a hose.Hopefully you found this review helpful.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 17 October 2020,Merrell

"merrell women's alverstone hiking shoe, brindle, 7.5 uk",comfortable right out of the box; wide toe box perfect for me,"Very pleased with these Merrell Alverstone hiking shoes. I have flat and wide feet and ordered 1/2 size up from my usual and it's a comfortable fit. No more black toenails from smashing toes against the front of my shoe (yes, lacing the shoestrings correctly helps also). The Alverstone sole isn't as deeply grooved as the Moabs, and the Alverstone do not have the vibram sole, but I also paid $20 less for these shoes. I hope the Alverstones will last much longer than my Fila and Saucony walking shoes where the soles gets worn-out smooth after a 4-5 months of hiking once a week.I'm saving up money for a pair of $100 Merrell Moabs for better traction and grip. Merrell makes shoes that fit the shape of my feet; it's very hard to find comfortable and durable shoes that look good, as well. I want everything, haha!I purchased my Alverstones from Gear Coop, good seller. Earlier, I had bought the shoes from Zappos but got a defective/previously-returned item; one of the heels squeaked!

"asics - mens solution speed ff shoes, 8 uk, cherry tomato/black","Great for tennis, really high end at a great price because of inexplicable reviews","I don't understand people leaving bad reviews here, I just got them, put them on and went to play. There is NO CLICKING sound, if anything they are sticky to normal floors out of the box and the sole makes a sound as you walk, it obviously goes away on sidewalks or at the court and will not last. To those who complained about the toes being too tight or the ankle loose...learn to tie your shoelaces! They come with a normal cross lacing out of the box and yes, my right foot was too tight at the top, a slight pull and it was actually hurting on the side a bit, not on the other foot, but this is not how you tie your tennis shoes, on these I just went one across and then under the sides one up and across etc, the other lace straight up through the middle but there are a couple of aceptable ways, watch a video or something. The toe box is tight and slightly rigid at the top and sides, as it should be for a better feel and traction, it prevents your toes to hit the edge and hurt and the fit is perfect on its own, no need to get it tighter but  at the top of the lacing, however, the last eyelet is low, use it with the laces crossed and that will not allow your ankle to feel loose, but comfortable and secure without feeling the shoe. I had no problems at all lacing them right. No noises, they stick to the court like I have not felt before, they are light but you feel support and protection. Lots. It's amazing how quickly you take off in this when changing dictections. Tennis Warehouse gives these one of their best ratings on a pair of tennis shoes that I have seen. I don't know what so many here are talking about.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 16 May 2019,Asics
"asics - mens solution speed ff shoes, 8 uk, cherry tomato/black",As expected from ASICS,"From reading some of the prior reviews I had second thoughts but went for this shoe anyway.  I saw that it made top ten for tennis shoes 2018 and decided to try them for myself and I am not disappointed.There was no noise or weird sound from this sneaker as I walked.  It was perfect out of the box.  I also gotta say, based on a previous review, you must lace your shoes properly and those negative posts will not matter.  And looks!!! Plenty of complements as soon as I was in the public eye.  They are a great looking.Performance is great.  I feel secured and supported in this shoe.  Toes are wide and comfy, but fit perfect.  My favorite thing about buying online is that I have been wearing an Asics running shoe for about two years.  I bought them in a physical store and got the perfect fit (I've always went with New Balance or Nike in the past because of width).  Here I ordered the same size without trying on the Speed FF ever.  Same fit & function that made me chose the ASIC over the others the first time.  These are ASICS and they rock.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is just based on price.  Amazon online shopping used to crush the stores on price, but this one was about the same.  The benefit was solely them coming to my door step, but I do recommend this court shoe.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 6 July 2019,Asics

It may be that it does not bend easily.With all the grooves, I thought it would breathe easily but it really does not breathe well!Also, with all the grooves on the toe area, it always looks dirty like there is a ton of dust in between all the grooves.Knowing what I now know, I would not buy this particular model again.However, I really like other Asics tennis shoes and will certainly consider them in the future.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 13 August 2019,Asics

It did not feel like any of the dozens of asics shoes I ever bought.Asics is making great shoes and as soon as they make one, they discontinue the amazing product. Then they put out this garbage that is being discounted because it's a design flaw that they should take back from resellers.This experience frustrated me so much that I am heading out on a mission today to find a new brand of shoes that I can depend on that doesn't have lame colors I would never buy.Bye bye asics.

"asics - mens solution speed ff shoes, 8 uk, cherry tomato/black",This Is A Super Premium Tennis SNeaker,"The Solution Speed FF is clearly a premium tennis sneaker. The weight is 12 OZ (very light) and you notice the speed difference it makes, you are just quicker. The shoe fits well over my low volume foot with just a slight amount of too much width for my C-D wide foot. I must carefully tighten the shoe strings to get a close enough fit. I did get a popping sound on the left show for a few months  but it has dissipated after breaking in. Do not just  overlook this shoe because of the negative comments about popping, it isn't that big a deal to me at least and it went away for me. If you want to be faster, this a shoe to consider and it is reasonably priced. The sole grabs effectively and the ventilation is supreme as I sweat a lot and no issues with this shoe unlike others I have tried, it really breathes nicely. It may not be the ideal shoe for wet surfaces as my Adidas are better on wet surfaces. Works great on indoor gym floors or outdoor dry surfaces that I have tried,",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2019,Asics

Problem for me is the back of shoe -- the counter --  is a little too low.  This results in vertical movement of my heel when playing pickleball or tennis.  To compensate, I use the heel-lock lacing pattern,  but I have to pull the laces so tight it causes too much pressure on the top of my foot.  Will not buy this model again, nor do I recommend this model for pickleball or tennis.  Trying Gel Resolution 8 next...Dear ASICs,  what the h**l is going on?

"under armour women's breathe trainer x nm fitness shoes, blue (breathtaking blue/white/halo gray (300) 300), 8.5 uk",I love them,So I did read a bunch of reviews before I bought these so I ordered a size 7 and normal wear a 6.5 or 7 depending on the brand. I have really narrow feet so I went with the larger size that I normally wear with some brands. I will say when I first put them on I thought they might not work but the fabric of the shoes does loosen up a bit after you start wearing them. You have narrow and thin feet I suggest going up only a half a size unless you like looser fitting shoes.Moving in to the actual shoe. Absolutely beautiful true to color in the pictures. Extremely light weight. Very comfortable. Worth every penny.I am a caregiver for the elderly so I am in my feet a lot and I can tell you I have not gone home once with my feet hurting after wearing these shoes for sometimes longer than 24 hours straight.

I bought these during the prime day sale in the gray and blue color way.  These are incredibly comfortable and very cushioned.  I've been wanting to try Mizuno shoes anyway after owning brooks for a while.  The knit uppers are a bit thick so they aren't going to wear out soon, but conform well after walking in the shoes for a bit.  The half-bootie that wraps the sides of the foot and holds the tongue secure is very comfortable and unnoticeable even with thin socks.  The inside of the shoe at the toe is seamless thanks to the knit uppers and very comfortable and very foot hugging.  The heel area hugs well and keeps it from moving at all which is nice.  Overall the fit is very secure and the ride is very plush.  They do not have and stability control though so if you're an under or over pronator these shoes may not be for you.They are definitely true to size.  I ordered these in an 11R (which is also my size in brooks) and they fit spot on.  If you're looking for a very comfortable, plush, well built shoe, these are certainly a best buy.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 30 June 2021,Mizuno

I ended up getting a second new pair direct through Amazon to replace my falling apart pair. I would say that for walking, you can easily get 600+ miles out of these shoes. They are comfortable, they support your feet, and even when you're a bigger guy like me they don't cause me to have aches and pains I find in other shoes.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 6 July 2021,Mizuno

The last pair (wave runner 3) had gone almost 700 miles of city walking wear and tear before being replaced.

But these seem like beyond warm?  They are rated to -45 F / -43 C.  I am sure that snow boots don't need to be that warm.  I would never send my child out to play if it was -45 Fahrenheit!Because of the extra thick padding on the sides, these boots are extremely hard to get on.  My child had to shove and shove and shove his foot and hold onto my shoulders and shove some more.  And then repeat again with the other foot.  I have four children and have encountered my share of snowboots; these are harder to get on than is customary.  I can't imagine being the classroom teacher that had to help a whole room of children with these boots!My son is excited about them, and they will be warm, but unless they prove to be outstanding feature-wise or durability-wise, I don't plan to get them again.

They are very comfortable! They do run a bit wide, and I have more narrow feet. The heel is extremely cushioned, which is great, but because the shoes are a bit wide for me, my foot tends to slide off of the cushioning and go forward in the shoe. So I'm probably not getting all the benefit of the extremely cushioned heel. The other thing is, the tongue of the shoe tends to migrate toward the outside of the shoe, which isn't the end of the world, it just looks weird, so I'm forever re-adjusting it. But again, this could be because my foot has some room to slide around in the shoe.I'd definitely recommend this shoe to someone with a wider foot.

Needless to say I contacted to Amazon unsure if these were authentic or fake Cole Hans, they assured me they were authentic so I decided to give it another shot and order a replacement pair. The second pair came in much better quality -- but do note that the leather is VERY paper thin and so there was still some wrinkling/creasing on one of the pairs.

Personally, I do street run or jog in a gym about 3 miles daily and this shoes can protect my feet very well. Also this shoes is flexible, it is easy to wear without taking care about shoelaces. For people who are long distance runners, this shoes can decrease the vibration when you step on the ground and protect you knees. It can help you to keep stability when you are running and increase your balance.What Size You Should Buy?This pair of shoes fit a little bit bigger than normal shoes’ size. But I still recommend to go true to size on this shoes, because when we are doing some sports or jogging, our feet will be bigger than normal. If we buy this shoes for a half size down, it may be a little small and hurt our feet.What features this shoes has?For this pair of shoes, its breathability is excellent. When I am jogging at gym, I feel fresh and cool on my feet. I am a person who is likely to sweat when doing some sports, this shoes can keep my feet dry and comfortable. But if say the ability of water resistance, this pair of shoes cannot resist water at all, and if I wear this shoes on the street for a long time, I will feel cold because this shoes is thin and light, and it is ideal for summer.This shoes uses Boost technology of adidas to makes the shoe sole flexible and comfortable, and it has a fantastic looking so that when the first time that I saw this pair of shoes, I said “this is what I am looking for”. For its durability, I heard that the shoes with Ultra Boost technology didn’t do well on it. But for Boost technology, I wore this shoes for jogging and daily use since I received it and it did great so far.

"cleecli women's ballroom dance shoes latin salsa dancing shoes cross strap 2.5inch 3inch heel zb04, tan-2.5 inch heel, 8 uk",Finally Online Dance Shoes That Fit!,"Great news, sizing is as expected. Purchased normal U.S. dance shoe size. I wear size U.S. (woman's) 9 in street shoes and typically purchase 8 or 8.5 in dance shoes. Bought these in 8.5. For the most control when dancing, dance shoes are supposed to be just a tiny bit shorter than your foot-no overage. I bought them as an inexpensive practice shoe for the summer months. I dance at weekly outdoor salsa event and that dance suface is not the smooth hardwood one of a studio and can be brutal on shoes. I didnt want to ruin a new pair of $100+ dance shoes that way. Plus heat makes my feet swell, especially when I'm active which sizes me out of my winter practice shoes- remember what I said about sizing: should be no extra room in a well-fitting dance shoe. Interestingly I bought these after deciding to never purchase dance shoes on the internet again. The fit for dance shoes is so particular to your foot and the model shoe/brand you purchase, or at least thats been my experience. I've had only mediocre success with dance shoes I've purchased online. Sadly there are very few places locally where I can try on and purchase ballroom dance shoes. One is over 30 miles away, another has unpredictable hours and the owner rarely answers calls, or responds to VM. The studios where I dance have small collections, but not a lot of size variety so as much as I didn't want to purchase dance shoes online again, I was out of options. I was looking for a wide (stable), low heeled shoe that was very open in the front. I wanted enough material/straps to keep my foot stable, but little to rub on my foot and cause blisters. The peep-toe shoes with the small holes in the front have caused rubbing and blisters to my big toe in the past. My foot will always slide to the front of the (peep-toe) shoe and the place where it 'peeks' out of the hole in the front of the shoe, it rubs during dancing. These shoes do not rub or cause me blisters. They are stable and cushioned much more than I expected. They actually feel a bit plush and ' bouncy' because of the cushioning in the sole of the shoe, which I liked. The clasp is awesome because it allows you to choose the tightness of your strap and once you lock that in with the buckle, you only have to slide the buckle piece in and out of the clasp making getting in and out of the shoe quick and easy. One of the earlier reviewers of this shoe wasn't aware that design is intentional and thought her shoe was broken.The fastening straps of the shoe can be cut if they are too long. I haven't cut mine, but I did punch some additional holes in the straps so they would be tight enough on the top of my foot. All this is normal when dialing in your personal fit in a dance shoe. I'm very happy to say they've suited the purpose I bought them for and are holding up well in the month or so I've been using them. I haven't gotten blisters with these shoes rubbing my foot in the wrong way. Yay! Best internet dance shoe purchase to-date. I can finally lay-off using the leukatape I'd started wrapping my feet/toes with in my other dance shoes. Long nights of social dancing usually meant blisters. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this relatively inexpensive shoe. It is inexpensive, but not cheap. Also, they may not be show-stoppers, but they are pretty enough, and most importantly, comfortable practice shoes, which means I can dance longer and happier! The mesh is holding up well too. Oh, they also came with an inexpensive dust bag-perfect for carrying to practice or to socials. If it helps, my foot is: average width, flat, narrow heel. If you will be using this for ballroom dance and have a very narrow foot, I think this shoe may be too wide for you. Average to slightly wider feet (across the the forefoot) will likely fit this shoe best.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2018,Cleecli

"cleecli women's ballroom dance shoes latin salsa dancing shoes cross strap 2.5inch 3inch heel zb04, tan-2.5 inch heel, 8 uk",Decently comfortable,"I ordered these shoes after trying out 3"" ""pimp/disco"" style platforms. The big issues with platform shoes were 1) they were made in every other size, and my size apparently falls right in between, and 2) they are very heavy.The primary reason to get these shoes was to get extra height as one of my dance partners is same height as me barefoot, and she wears heels. I also wear these shoes to practice different posture for balance and to just mess around.Comfort: these are decently comfortable. I don't mind wearing them but I find them less comfortable once I stop dancing and start standing around. My impression is I need a wider toe box compared to what some shoes offer and these seem to be fine in this regard.For reference, i usually wear men's size 10 and these shoes in size 12 fit me well.I do find that it is more difficult to lead in these shoes compared to standard men's ballroom dance shoes, in part because the leader must absorb the follower's energy and this is easier with wider soles, and because leader's spins are often quicker than follower's spins/turns which again demands better balance from the leader.",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 1 April 2019,Cleecli

They blistered my two end toes, but for a cheaper shoe they are comfortable, so I put moleskin on the outer edge where it rubbed and that helped. My right foot is significantly bigger than my left and both shoes fit suitably.  In heels I’m almost a whole size smaller so I ordered a 9 1/2 which is perfect. The only thing that’s off is the plastic heel layer is very slippery on the dance floor and it makes it hard to put full weight on one foot when dancing. I’ve ordered heel grips, hoping they do the trick. Hope this helps!",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 19 October 2018,Cleecli
"cleecli women's ballroom dance shoes latin salsa dancing shoes cross strap 2.5inch 3inch heel zb04, tan-2.5 inch heel, 8 uk",Sizing chart is off--these are way too small,"I got these shoes for my daughter in middle school who is taking a social dance class. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them because it's only a one-semester class, and she is not going to need them after that. These seemed like a good deal, so I carefully measured her feet and used the sizing chart to order a size 6.5--even though she wears between a size 8-9  street shoe. Her feet are a little on the wide side, but not wide enough that she can't wear 'regular' (non-wide width or 'B' width) shoes. When these shoes came, they were size 7 (not the 6.5 I ordered), but it didn't even matter because the shoes were several sizes too small. She could cram her feet into them after several minutes of struggling, but it was easy to see that the straps dug into her skin and her toes were off the edge. I sent them back. I wanted to order a size 8, but the style she had to have for her class (brown color and 2.5-inch heel) was not available (sold out/backordered). I didn't have time to order something else from Amazon (even with 2-day shipping) and wait for it to be delivered, so I ended up going to a local dance store and spending A LOT more money on something that she could try on that was approved for her class. She also needed heel guards, which were easy to find at the local store, but almost impossible to try to determine the right size and shape for this dance shoe on Amazon. Anyone who sells dance shoes should also sell heel guards to fit them. I would have loved to have gotten these in a size 8--I think they would have worked and been a good shoe for what we needed at a good price.",3.0,Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2021,Cleecli

black diamond mens zone climbing shoes,Great Entry Level to Intermediate Bouldering Shoe,"Details:Black Diamond did a great job on the build of this shoe and it shows. The attention to detail is excellent. Good mid range shoe. More on the aggresive side but not extreme. Although the way that the shoes molded sole was built makes it an even range shoe. So it does well on overhangs and small foot chips when needed. The sole has a little flex or it can maintain the drop as well.Sizing:Black Diamond typically makes their shoes so you can order them in street shoe sizes. Although there are thousands of different feet variations so choose wisely. As for me, I have a wider foot base, more natural volume to my foot structure and proportionate toe size. So my street shoe size 10.5 is slightly too tight. I originally tried a 10 but that was way to small for my feet. Even considering a little stretch in time there's no way those would fit me. 10.5 was a squeeze for sure a little painful but bearable but I want to climb longer overhang routes so I opted for an 11 so I can wear them longer during sessions. These won't stretch too much because they are synthetic. Also I live in California and when you climb outside in the heat you're feet naturally swell up a bit from the weather and or the approach so they are perfect! That's my two cents.

dr. comfort winner-x men's therapeutic diabetic extra depth shoe: 10 x-wide (xw/6e) white,Call the Doctor,"I deal with a lot of swelling in my feet, and neuropathic pain as well. This is my second pair of Dr. Comfort's and they have pluses and minuses over the previous pair.Pluses:Extra ""depth"" to the shoe - Most of the swelling I have is on the top of my feet, with a little less to the sides. Having this extra depth keeps my foot from feeling mooshed into the shoe, putting extra pressure on the swollen areas.Velco Straps/Tongue design - Someone actually did a little engineering here. Instead of a regular flapper of a tongue this shoe has no tongue but a separation to the side of the shoe that opens wide, allowing a lot easier access to get one's foot into the shoe without having to yank the things on over your feet. The straps make adjusting the amount of pressure to hold the foot in place highly adjustable.Minuses:Inserts - Although these come  with very high quality inserts, they aren't as comfortable as my original Dr. Comforts. Not as well padded and not as good arch support. It probably would never be noticeable though if I hadn't had the first pair to compare.Inner Padding - The insides of my originals were soft as lamb's wool. While these are fairly comfortable, they are the level of cooshiness I've come to expect.The minuses are relative though.

"mizuno women's wave creation waveknit 2 road running shoe, quiet shadeblack, 3.5 uk",Runs Sooo Small!,"First of all, I’m a size 6.5 in almost every normally sized shoe/sneaker/sandal etc. The sizing of this sneaker (and another Mizuno style of running shoe that I tried on in-store) is completely wonky! I started by ordering my regular size, and it was So Small and Painful. So then ordered a 7, and then a 7.5, and finally an 8(!) before I could put them on my feet without my toes getting smushed up at the front. Unfortunately, in the size that fit me the best, the arch support of the sneaker was positioned in the wrong place, so it was really bothersome and uncomfortable to wear. Also, the material by my ankles rubbed. On the positive side - I can say that the cushioning and the integrated tongue were nice.I bought and returned 4 pairs of the same style of sneaker to Amazon and have nothing to show for it, but a complete lack of confidence in Mizuno sneakers. I’m going to try a different brand. Wish me luck…",1.0,Reviewed in the United States on 5 July 2021,Mizuno

I had seen similar reviews for other Mizuno shoes about sizing, but most reviews of this particular shoe said they fit true to size. I would disagree.

I am a 7 1/2 in regular shoes but always order an 8 or 8 1/2 in mizuno since they tend to run small. Bought an 8 1/2 and they don’t fit at all. The heel padding pushes your foot so far forward your toe is crammed at the front of the toe box. The plastic pieces that the laces attach to are rigid so if you try to tighten the laces to keep your foot back they push into the sides of your foot giving you blisters. This is more than a size issue, it’s an overall fit issue. Unfortunately I missed the return window so have tried to make these work, but there is just no way.

I can’t say now great they will be clipped in to my peloton (still waiting... delivery just got pushed back again) but I tried them on my cheaper bike that doesn’t use clip in pedals and they seem sturdy but breathable.I initially ordered a larger size since a lot of the other shoes I’ve tried tended to run narrow and small. These do not. I have wider feet and these are by far the most comfortable. They seem like they’re pretty sturdy and they’re easy to get on/off unlike other cycle shoes I have tried.Important to me is they fit my orthotics/inserts. I struggle with plantar fasciitis flare ups every now and then so I wear orthotics whenever I do any exercise, so if anyone was wondering, mine fit in this shoe just fine.No, they do not come with clips, so purchase those separately. Majority of cycle shoes don't come with clips btw.If anything happens with them, I’ll update but from my use so far, they fit my wide-ish feet, are comfortable, easy on/off, and I actually think the print is fun!",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2021,Mebike

"merrell men's moab fst waterproof hiking shoe, brown, 7.5 d(m) uk","A good shoe, but it does get warm.","UPDATE: April 2019 (original review below):  By November 2018, I stopped wearing these shoes regularly because they were just too hot to wear comfortably for long periods.  I cannot recommend these shoes because they just become too hot.  The heat results in excessive sweating and the shoes smell bad as a result.  Find another pair.  Reducing review to two stars.-----------Original review:I ordered these Merrell Men's Moab fST Waterproof Hiking Shoes to replace a set of Keen hiking shoes that I had worn out.  The Keens are excellent shoes and very comfortable, but they tend to get extensive wear on the soles (particularly for me, the heels wear out within 9 mos).  This review is my initial impression and I will update if anything changes.FIT:  The shoes fit as expected.  They seem a bit tighter than the Keen equivalent but are as expected for the size.COMFORT: These waterproof shoes get hot and are hotter than the Keen equivalent waterproof shoe.  The foot bed is definitely not as good as the Keen, probably the most notable difference.WATERPROOF: So far, so good.  I had to wade into shallow water and my feet were dry until the water got deep enough to overtop the shoe.OVERALL QUALITY: I have high hopes that the heel on this shoe will not wear as quickly.  Quality of the shoes seems very high.I rate these shoes as 4 stars out of 5, with the subtraction coming for the less comfortable foot bed than the competition and the lessened breathability resulting in more heat in the foot.  I can't help but feel that if the shoe had a breathable but waterproof fabric, the shoes would feel cooler and more comfortable for extended wear.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 26 March 2018,Merrell
"merrell men's moab fst waterproof hiking shoe, brown, 7.5 d(m) uk",Nice looking casual / athletic shoe,"I've been a Merrell wearer for around 10 years, now and have wanted to try their more casual line.  I typically buy Moabs or Chameleon Stretch Gore-Tex and expected these to feel a lot more flimsy.  While they are a little lighter, they still feel durable and look to be well made.  The laces are heavy-duty and a good length.  The Vibram soles feel a little softer than what the Moabs use, but I haven't noticed quick wear on them.  I haven't tested them for water resistance, at this point, but will update if I do.Pros:Lighter than the outdoor hiking shoes.Look sharp and athletic.Good gripping soles.Fits as expected.Comfortable for hiking and light running.Cons:The fit is a little less secure than the outdoor shoes, do to the lack of the ""heel lock"" lace hole.  I wish it was there, but since I wanted these for a casual shoe, it's not a deal-breaker.Arch is a little higher than I expected.  It could break in to where it needs to be after a while.Update:These just aren't breaking in to be comfortable and the loose fit around the ankle is becoming a problem.  I wear low / no-show socks and it rubs badly on the heel area.",3.0,Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2018,Merrell

"dunham men's captain boat shoe, blue multi, 11.5 x-wide",Can't replace laces because they sewed them into the shoe... Ridiculous,They sewed the damn shoe laces into the back of the shoe. Now in order to switch to the type of laces I prefer I have to cut the original laces so that I can put the ones I like in. I'll wait for a bit before I do that but this is not starting off well.What even worse is they didn't even make the laces even before sewing the lace into the back end of the shoe so on one foot the lace is a solid 6 inch longer on one side. I can get past this for a comfortable shoe but it's a severe annoyance that when I do replace the laces that I cannot run them the way they were intended to go...Stupid move on the manufacturers part. They got 2 stars so far because they fit like they are supposed to but still really annoyed about the laces being sown in....,2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 20 November 2019,Dunham
"dunham men's captain boat shoe, blue multi, 11.5 x-wide","Comfortable shoe, but with serious problems","I've had these shoes before and I loved the comfort and fit, but this model has some serious problems.  Firstly, the shoe has a serious design flaw.  The laces are sewn in place and not replaceable!  The laces wrap all the way around the heel, as a real moccasin would, but they are sewn in at the heel.  If your lace wears out, as mine did, the shoe is worthless.  The first time this happened, New Balance was kind enough to replace the shoe.  The second time, the shoe was  pretty well worn out, so I just bought a new pair.  That's when I discovered the second problem.  After only wearing the shoe a week (a week!) the leather ripped out along the stitching near the base of the tongue on the left shoe.  OK, no problem, I returned the shoe to Amazon and got another pair.  The 2nd pair popped a stitch at the same place on the right shoe BEFORE I GOT THE SHOE ON MY FOOT!!  Just opening up the shoe caused a tear.  Now I have to return the second pair too, this time for a refund.It looks like NB is having some manufacturing problems, (you can see how some stitching is off a tiny fraction, actually weakening the leather by crossing the pre-punched holes where pieces are stitched together) so as much as I liked this shoe when I first bought it several years ago, I won't be buying it again anytime shoe.",2.0,Reviewed in the United States on 14 May 2015,Dunham
"dunham men's captain boat shoe, blue multi, 11.5 x-wide",Very good boat shoes,"These Dunham Captain boat shoes retail for $120 and I paid less than $40 here on Amazon.  So, that's good.  The shoes are actually very good quality with excellent functionality.  The fit is as expected and it wears like a comfortable tennis shoe.  The sole is non-slip rubber and it grips great.  I spent 7 days on my boat in wet conditions right after buying these shoes and they preformed like a champ.  The leather is water-proof.  The shoe will not get water-logged.  The nylon vents (light brown areas) allowed for water drainage (I did walk in the water a few times just to see how they functioned).  There's also what New Balance calls a ""rollbar"" in the heal.  Basically, it provides stability to prevent your ankle from rolling right or left.. oddly, I found this feature very beneficial.  When you're walking on a slipper surface, your ankles can do funny thing.  This rollbar functions from below your heel... it's not like an ankle brace, but it works great.  So the design and functionality is excellent.  I'm not sure about the quality since I've only owned them for about a month. They're made in China.  If New Balance made them in the USA (like the 990s), I would've given these shoes 5 stars.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 23 April 2015,Dunham
"dunham men's captain boat shoe, blue multi, 11.5 x-wide",Perfect Fit; Amazing Quality and Comfort,"What an awesome, high-quality, comfortable shoe. I can't say I've been able to say that for the past decade or so -- it seems most shoes are only built to last about three months before they fall apart.I have enormous feet and - as I'm sure anyone reading this for that very reason understands - it is difficult to find stylish, comfortable shoes for everyday wear.If you have a large, wide food -- look no further. This shoe not only fit me perfectly out of the box, it was nearly 100% perfectly comfortable with minimal break-in (just under a week with minimal wear), and looks great to boot. The soles are thick enough to offer great support, but not thick and awkward enough that they look like clunky orthopedic clown shoes.This shoe looks great with slacks and would fit in a dressy or casual environment. I'll be picking up a spare set out of fear that they stop making them.PROS:•Great Fit for Wide Feet (4E)•Quality Construction•Comfortable for All-Day Wear / Walking•Doesn't Look Like a Boat on Your Foot (round-toe shoes in large sizes tend to look comical)CONS:•Stiff Heel for the First Week (I taped my heels under my socks to minimize blisters; heel seems to have broken in within 4 days)•Toe is Rounded (I prefer squared toes for style reasons, but this still looks nice)",5.0,Reviewed in the United States on 14 September 2017,Dunham

The Adipower is ok by comparison. The toe bot accommodates my wide feet and I'm able to reasonably tighten them so my foot feels secure. I trust them more than the shoes with the weird tightening mechanism. You may not fall in love with them, but they aren't that expensive and have a non compressible heel. I think some other people talked about doing things other than lifting. They have little in the way of padding, which is good. I wouldnt suggest doing cardio or walking in them (I get sore from the foot up if i walk too long in lifting shoes). You can bend your foot enough for the split jerk if you Olympic Lift.

asics gel-kayano 5 360 men&#39;s running shoes,Super comfy for a casual shoe,Great product no problems,5.0,Reviewed in Canada on 21 August 2020,Asics
asics gel-kayano 5 360 men&#39;s running shoes,Great comfy pair of tennis!,"I gave these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because of the insoles.  I have sensitive feet, am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day, and have a bad back so I’m critical about my footwear and often purchase premium insoles for my most worn shoes, boots, and even my house slippers.  The shoes themselves are excellent - ASICS gel never disappoints!  These have a very breathable construction to prevent foot sweating (and future stink) that some shoes may not provide.  My feet sweat more than the average joe so I consider breathable construction critical as well.  I love the color choices and the one I chose looks great with a pair of jeans and  a t-shirt and are not a total eye catcher.  Some women with a big bust may be able to relate to this similarity.  Sure, it’s great to show off and look good, but I like a fairly modest look.  If you are looking for a great brand of tennis shoes that are durable, lasting, colorful, comfortable, and cozy, consider ASICS gel brand shoes.  For those of you with lower back pain who visit chiropractors whom do mention finding a comfortable pair of footwear and insoles, I have not tried much but the Dr. School’s branded insoles.  They have several types and the packaging is designed where a buyer can squeeze the insoles anf feel the material they are made of.  Anyway, these shoes are not the first pair of ASICS gel shoes I have owned over the years and they do not disappoint.  If I had a kid, I would bring him or her up in ASICS for sure- and perhaps some cute looking gorilla slippers or maybe even some of those shoes that resemble lizard feet and “growl” when the kids stomp their feet.  I also like Nike Air, Sketchers, and k-Swiss “tubbers”.  They are also kind to a middle-aged man wit s bit of back pain.  Lift with your knees, wear comfortable shoes, stretch a couple minutes in bed when you first wake up, don’t sit on a huge wallet that makes you bum uncomfortable, take it easy, and visit a chiropractor twice within a week when back problems become an issue and you’ll be happy.  It wouldn’t hurt getting a massage either from time to time either.  Oh, and be critical on the chairs you sit on often and adjust your automobile lumbar support properly too.  You can do a lot of little things on your own like that and they even sell automobile seat mats that massage your butt and back too.  But yeah, a good pair of shoes is top on the list and ASICS gel does not disappoint!",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2021,Asics
asics gel-kayano 5 360 men&#39;s running shoes,Great shoes overall,"I love Asics and have been wearing them for like 20+ years. I'm a huge fan of the Kayano series. So when I saw these, I was very intrigued. I wear them for the gym and they're great for it—I wouldn't recommend running for long distances in them like regular Kayanos—because they're a lot stiffer.Only reason why I gave it four stars is because the sole/tread seems to be made of a different, slicker material. So when you walk outside on wet surfaces, it's much more slippery than any other Asics I've had—much less other regular Kayanos.Otherwise, it's a great shoe for the gym because of the tread pattern under the arch. Love the design and looks of it too.",4.0,Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2020,Asics
asics gel-kayano 5 360 men&#39;s running shoes,Inner material is causing blisters,"I bought these as my regular running shoes. I usually wear size 11.5 but upon trying these decided that the extra room might be causing extra movement leading to a burning sensation and ultimately, blisters on my little toes. I then exchanged them for size 11 which feel snug and good initially. The padding is thick and feels very cushioned on walking or running. However, after about 45 mins and 5 miles of running, my feet like they are on fire. My little toes have been getting painful blisters. I think the inner material is causing a lot of friction and heat buildup. I tried giving them a chance and had them for a month or so but I am going to go back to my older climacool Adidas that have perforated soles and have never given me any problems.",3.0,Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2020,Asics

"ecco men's jamestown hydromax chukka boot, coffee nubuck, 9/9.5 uk",Expectations Well and Truly Exceeded,"I am a bit over 50yo and I have probably owned a grand total of five or six pairs of boots during my life. This is a very small number of boots given I grew up where we consistently had snow cover during the winter. I have worn each pair of those boots, maybe, a maximum of three or four times each before chucking them out even though they were all 'good quality' boots and in excellent shape. I found that the slip-on boots quickly became loose, the ones with many eyelets took me forever to put on and take off and the ones with only a few eyelets never really felt they were on quite right. I can also say they were all uniformly pretty uncomfortable, particularly when you consider I would rather have cold, wet, feet in freezing temperatures then wear those boots. That really should tell you something. Anyway a few years back I moved to a place in country Victoria, Australia. Although it is not quite as wet and as cold as where I grew up, I do often end up traipsing through sodden fields and forests. Early onset senility must have begun to set in, because, after having wasted so much money boots in the past, I thought it would be a good idea to waste some more money on a new pair I would hate. After spending what seemed like a week on the internet looking at boots 24/7, I finally settled on a pair of ECCO Jamestown Hydromax Chukka's. Simply put, they are unbelievably comfortable, such that they have only come off when I have showered or slept. This is despite having more than half-a-dozen more appropriate and expensive pairs of shoes/slippers for whatever it was I was doing at the time for which boots really the footwear for the job.

"adidas men's sprintstar m running shoe, black/white/signal coral, 10 uk",Not bad but not great,These are good if you're looking for an entry-level Sprint Spike. Reason I only give it three stars though is because the strike plate is not solid across the bottom. It is rubber and can bend through the arch and heel. This makes it good for a 400m but not for a 100 and 200 meter race. In a 100 and 200m race having a solid strike plate through the heel Forces you to stay on your toes. It is a lot harder to stay on your toes all the way through 400 race. So the flexion in this strike plate being made of soft rubber allows the heel to flex and touch the ground. But I needed a shoe for a shorter Sprint that has a solid strike plate all the way through to the heel.,3.0,Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2020,Adidas

They feel like they are made to come with a drill. They were good in winter in London and not at all sweaty or too hot. They had good grip and stood up to puddles and walks in the city and the country. I personally put other inner soles inside but that’s my preference with most shoes. I did take them for a spin in California before I left to London and I will say that they felt a bit gammy under those conditions. They are not very breathable.

I originally ordered the Cael v8.0s in a 10.5US and had to return them because they were too narrow. I ordered these in an 11US (a full size larger than normal for me) and they fit comfortably snug. I got them for martial arts and they will also be good for weight training. They grip great, but still allow twisting without catching on the mat. I like the mid-high top design as they keep my heel in place and add a bit of extra ankle support. The tongue is not too bulky either.

"asics matcontrol wrestling shoes, black/black, size 13",Don't Fret Much About Fit,"First of all I bought these shoes to wear while lifting weights, so I have no idea how well they perform on the mat, but they look and feel great. They put your feet flat on the floor as if you were barefoot while giving ankle support; similar feel to Converse, except they contour to your feet and are more lightweight. However the soles will put you at a slight deficit, so keep that in mind if you plan on deadlifting.Personally I wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, Reebok and Nike. Occasionally I have to size down, like with Doc Martens (size 9-10) and Converse (9.5). I was skeptical of purchasing these online after reading negative reviews about the fit, so I went half a size up to be safe. After trying them on, I think they're overblown.

Most of them recommended getting a full size up, but I went with my gut feeling and just got a half size up. I usually wear a size 9 1/2 for most regular shoes, so I went with a size 10 for this boxing shoe. Fit was perfect. Of course, boxing shoes will always have that snug/tight feel, but the pair I got had just the right amount of tightness. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase!

Unfortunately they had no proper size, so I ended up ordering shoes online.The order came in time and in a good shape, but on my second visit to bouldering gym I noticed that one of the laces started to tear. I didn't pay enough attention to that and that was my big mistake. You can see on the pictures how the lace look like after just 5 bouldering sessions. It's almost totally ruined on the left shoe and started to tear on the right one.This is especially surprising as I do not tie shoes tightly (they're 3 sizes smaller).Obviously it's too late to return them now after 1.5 months and visible signs of usage (is it even possible to have no such signs on climbing shoes?)Later I found out that this issue is so common for La Sportiva Solutions that some shoe repairs even have a separate price for replacing laces on this particular model.

When I’m walking my dogs through the fields and the lawns in the summer, the dew soaks my shoes and wearing my barn boots looks a bit odd with shorts. These shoes are a perfect compromise - I can get them wet without worry and they look summery and cute. I’ve had more than a few compliments on them so I guess the neighbours agree that they are far superior to rubber barn boots for summer wear.",5.0,Reviewed in Canada on 10 July 2021,Saguaro
"saguaro mens womens kids lightweight breathable slip-on sneaker garden clogs beach sandals water shoes, purple/strip, 13 little kid","Fits just right, flexible, awesome","The media could not be loaded.
                




   Shoes looks exactly as advertised.Dismiss the marking on the white part of the shoes, I spilled something on them. These shoes are comfortable and fit just right; there is no sliding around or slipping off my feet, not too tight either, no chafing. I like to quickly slip them on when I need to run out the door grab my contact free delivery (SkipTheDishes or DoorDash), take the garbage/recycle/compost out to the curb, waking around the yard and maybe some light garden work.They seem very durable, yet very flexible. That said the red part of the shoe is so flexible that if you’re  in a hurry and ramming your foot into the shoes…the heel part will fold under your heel if the shoe just fit. They are comfortable to wear as slip-ons with the back of the shoe squished under your heel but if you want to wear as a regular shoe, making the adjustment using your finger or wiggling your foot is quick and easy.",5.0,Reviewed in Canada on 28 July 2021,Saguaro

adidas zx 2k boost mens fv9993 size 11,Nice style but not comfort.,"After this purchase I'm not sure I'll purchase another pair of adidas with this pair being my first.

The sole has nice cushion, but the toes area doesn't as much like the sneaker has an incline making it uncomfortable to walk in for a long period of time. The style and colors I love.
